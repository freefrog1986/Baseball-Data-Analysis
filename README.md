# Baseball Data Analysis

## Summary 

This is about exploring baseball data using Python.

### Questions

We care about the following two questions:   

1. What make players more likely to be voted into Hall of Fame.

2. What are the characteristics of baseball players with the highest salaries?   

First, translate those questions to make it more specific.    

1. What's the relationship of batting, pitching and fielding statistics and Hall of Fame members?   

2. What's the relationship of Hall of Fame members, All-star player, awards, and salary?

### Data

#### Data Acquisition

Downloading data from [this link](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/baseballdatabank-2017.1.zip).   

This dataset contains 28 csv including pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2016.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.   

More details are in the [readme file](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2016.txt).   

To answer those two questions, we only need some of those files including Master, AllStarFull, HallofFame, AwardsPlayers, Salaries, Batting, Pitching, Fielding, BattingPost, PitchingPost, FieldingOF, FieldingPost, FieldingOFsplit.
